When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate with others, or be able to work from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want to see changes being made by a collaborator until you are
ready. That could be distracting.
