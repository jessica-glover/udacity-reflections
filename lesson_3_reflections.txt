When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate with others, or be able to work from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want to see changes being made by a collaborator until you are
ready. That could be distracting.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

A fork is like a clone that links to the original owner's repository. You would
use a fork when you want to modify their code, but aren't a collaborator. Using
a fork gives them credit for the work they've done. A clone is a copy of a
repository. You might clone a repository that you've authored onto another
work station, or you might clone another author's repository to contribute code
to it. A branch is a part of a repository. It's useful for keeping experimental
code separate from other code, or for collaborators to keep their changes
separate until they are ready to merge. Collaborators would use branches instead
of forks, because they only need to keep their code separate temporarily.
